# spectral_analysis
	If using linux/macOS, install iSpec directly from the guides at https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/installation/linux or https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/installation/osx/anacondapython.
 	Make sure all of the packages from the list at https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/installation/linux/apt are installed.
 
	If using windows, then you will need to set up a virtual machine to perform analysis. I did this using https://www.virtualbox.org/ and following the guide on https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-on-virtualbox. If the window refuses to go into fullscreen mode, follow the guide on https://www.itzgeek.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-ubuntu-20-04/.
	To install iSpec in the virtual machine, follow the guide at https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/installation/linux/anacondapython. Make sure all of the packages from the list at https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/installation/linux/apt are installed. 
	All functions necessary for spectral analysis are contained within the .py files, with the PAWS jupyter notebook set up as a GUI to utilise these.
	It is important to check the format of your spectra - the code has been optimised for use with SOPHIE spectra. Depending on the instrument, you may be working with spectra of a different resolution so make sure to check this (for both HE and HR spectra if relevant). Also, some spectra may already be coadded, normalised or rv/telluric/barycentric velocity corrected - if so, you can select yes/no as appropriate in the GUI.
